"I developed a Twitter sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. After fine-tuning the model for better accuracy, I built a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard to visualize the sentiment predictions in real time, allowing users to easily input tweets and analyze the results interactively."
